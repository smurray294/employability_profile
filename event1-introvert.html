              <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>This activity involved completing a LinkedIn Learning course on the experiences of introverts and how to frame their unique perspective as strength(s) in the workplace.
              I worked through the course online, and as an introvert, found it quite interesting. I did realise I have always sort of viewed my introversion as the 'bad one' when 
              compared to extroversion. I had never heard it spoken about in this context before, and whilst it makes complete sense that companies seek to maximise the strengths of all
              their employees, it was a refreshing and somewhat empowering experience. It has definitely given me a bit to think about in terms of embracing and supporting what I need to
              do to recharge my battery, and how that will affect my performance in the workplace.</p>

              <h2>Additional Comments</h2>
              <p>One thing I did find interesting that they didn't really touch on, is that it is always framed as either introvert or extrovert. I would have thought, like many other things in life,
              that this would be another spectrum, and you'd often find people who are in the middle, or who exhibit traits from both sides. I think this is something that could be explored
              further, as I know I have traits from both sides, so it is definitely something I need to keep in mind in the future.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This course was recommended to me before looking deeper into cutting edge technologies regarding AI and LLMs. It was a reasonably quick course, but introduced and taught me about how LLMs work in principle (transformers, encoder/decoder architecture), what led to their creation (broader field of natural language processing), what types of models are better at what tasks, and real world restrictions on the performance of these models. Of fundamental importance was the idea of a transformer, and I feel learning more about these is invaluable to understanding how LLMs operate. It has given me a lot to think about going forward, as whilst soon I will have an ‘AI degree’, we’ve done nothing related to LLMs, and they are the face of AI currently. Continued learning into the future will be paramount in this industry.</p>

<h2>Additional Comments</h2>
<p>Learning about the real world issues associated with their function was quite interesting - training a new LLM from start to finish has an immense carbon footprint compared to other human activities, even from a company that is actively trying to reduce it as much as possible, so generally we try to rely on “pretrained” models (this training process has been done previously and we don’t repeat it) and instead focus on fine tuning those models for our specific goal or task. This leads to other issues like biases, and the course showed that even models that aren’t trained on ‘the whole internet’ (and hence get any negatives there) still develop biases when suggesting jobs based on gender. The job prostitute somehow got into the top 5 for women, even in a model that was trained with guidance to avoid this type of bias from seeping into the training/data.</p>
